- SUBWorld closely relates to Reinforcement Learning and provides an analogy to the ChemistryLab space
- Several potential changes were discussed to SUBWorld
  - Cost is a random death event
  - Introduce a separate bar for damage
  - Losing fuel is a cost, potential damage costs fuel
  - Breaching and submerging costs more fuel
  - Introduce set costs for breaching and submerging
  - Ensuring breaching/submerging costs are separate, such that they can be deducted or simply stated
  - Reward has been integrated, but should be decoupled
  - Integrate multiple reward functions
  - Include an "insurance rate" to better represent risk
