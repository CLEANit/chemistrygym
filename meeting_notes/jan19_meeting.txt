- Aid the new co-ops in difficulties understanding the project

- Add the automatic search for compatible reactions adds a lot of utility

- Finalize the reward function?
- Adding logging functions (I did this but it got swept under the rug)
- Improve uniformity between the benches (ie. the extraction bench does not match the discrete/continuous nature of the observation spaces of the other benches)
- Adding an observation state to all the benches
- Fixing issues with setup.py
- *Stuff that was added during the fall term but was not addressed*
