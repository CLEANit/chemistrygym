# Meeting Notes
## Date: October 7, 2020
    *Meeting Summary:* So we had a short meeting, almost everyone is busy with courses, Sriram had some system issues accessing the NRC server, but it is fine now, he will be setting up the environment and trying some initial algorithms. Mitchell is reading some papers. Next week is reading week at waterloo so we will cancel the meeting and meeting two weeks from now. I will be on vacation that week but you can meet without me.

### Sriram

- will implement TD3 or SACritic
- [ ] will try to use settings:
    - random values
    - the particular values for each variable

### Mitchell
