Distillation Bench:

- Needs 3 vessels
- Boil (input) vessel and 2 beakers

- Actions:
	- Add/remove heat to boil vessel
	- Pour boil vessel to beaker 1
	- Pour beaker 1 into beaker 2
	- Pour beaker 1 into boil vessel
	- Pour beaker 2 into boil vessel
	- Done

- Processes:
	- Change in temperature by addition/removal of heat by Q = mcT
	- Boiling of materials
	- Boiled off materials simply appear in beaker 1 already at room temperature

- Reward:
	- Want to obtain all target material in a vessel with no other materials
	- Use purity of materials in vessel (mol of target/mol of all materials in vessel)
	- Discourage target material in multiple vessels

- How to Boil:
	1. Heat is added until we reach the boiling point of a material (temp of the vessel rises using weighted c)
	2. Remaining heat is used to perform the phase transition of the material (no vessel temp change)
	3. If heat remains after all of boiled material has boiled off, return to step 1
	4. If no heat remains, but material to be boiled off remains, end the action and maintain vessel temp

- Overview of Changes:
	- Make new Distillation file
	- Make new distillation engine
	- Make new distillation Bench
	- Add heat change in vessel file
	- Register the new environment
